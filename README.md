**Homework 10** <br/>
Calculates the minimum of the function $sin(x)^2 + sin(y)^2$. Since the function is periodic, 
and has infinitely many roots, the starting guess is chosen to be ($3\frac{\pi}{4}$, $3\frac{\pi}{4}$). 
This is done to make the plausible solution be ($\pi$, $\pi$)  instead of any of the other 
solutions. 
To run the code, type `python3 driver.py`. Make sure you have `scipy` installed
on your local machine. <br/>
The code prints the solution found, the expected solution ($\pi$, $\pi$) and the error.
